# Human Resource Dashboard (India) 🇮🇳

This project is an interactive HR dashboard created using **Tableau**, inspired by [Baraa Khatib Salkini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baraa-khatib-salkini/)'s US-based dashboard, but adapted entirely for **India-specific data and insights**. It provides deep insights into employee demographics, salary distribution, job roles, education levels, hiring status, and more.
